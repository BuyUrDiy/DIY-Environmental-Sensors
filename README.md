# DIY-Environmental-Sensors
This is a collection of Arduino code and 3d files for use in creating DIY environmental sensor systems. 

This is in congunction wiht the BuyUrDiy project and website. The files here were orginally created for these projects listed on that website. Feel free to modify and make these better; I'm sure there are better and more efficient ways to do everything. 

In the Arduino folder; are 3 main folders. One for each of the different Arduino projects. The 'Blank' code is a generic logger code. These code are setup so you can modify them to include whatever sensor you are using. The additional files are examples of code used for different sensors I've used in the past. 

In the 3D file folder; are a few different 3D files that can be used to 3D print some very simple mounts for the Arduinos. These mounts are just intended to give you ideas for ways these electronics can be held together.
