# DIY-Environmental-Sensors
This is a collection of Arduino code and 3d files for use in creating DIY environmental sensor systems. 

This is in congunction with the BuyUrDiy project and website. The files here work with the projects outlined on that website. Feel free to modify and make these better; I'm sure there are better and more efficient ways to do everything. Also; these are all for Arduino platfrorms working with the ATmega328P. This means that as long as your RTC is the same, all the code (Version Uno, Nano and Pro Mini) would work interchangable with any of the platforms. Different code is used for the Uno since it is intended to work with a diffrent RTC than the Nano / Pro Mini version. Also different code is used to demonstrate that there are a myraid of ways to achieve the same outcome.


In the Arduino folder; are 3 main folders. One for each of the different Arduino projects (Uno, Nano and Pro Mini). The 'Blank' code is the generic logger code. The Blank code is setup so you can modify them to include whatever sensor you are using. The additional files (CO2, conductivity, etc) are examples of code used for different sensors I've build out in the past. Use these to help guide your own sensor builds.  


In the 3D file folder; are a few different 3D files that can be used to 3D print some very simple mounts for the Arduinos. These mounts are just intended to give you ideas for ways these electronics can be held together. There are no files for the Uno, as these typcially already have a decent plastic mounting plate included. Use these 3d files as inspiration for new and better designs.
